        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p1>Rom acts as a barrier to protect the commonfolk from the unseen. Creatures 
            otherwise invisible to the eye such as the Amygdalas. Previously human, it 
            has made a pact with Kos in exchange for these powers.

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>As a being closely related to the Great Ones, Rom is weak to bolt damage.</li>
            <li>The safer method is to finish all the spiders before moving onto Rom.</li>
            <li>Be wary of when it curls upwards as it will explode and most likely one-shot you.</li>
