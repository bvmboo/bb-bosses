        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p1>The Healing Church has been working on many ways to elevate themselves to 
            the realm of the Great Ones. The Celestial Emissary is one of the results. 
            An artificially created Great One, from possibly the orphans that were kidnapped 
            to conduct experiments on.

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This boss is very weak against bolt damage.</li>
            <li>Using a weapon with wide range attacks can make this fight easier to push away smaller mob.</li>
            <li>You can kill all the other mob before the main boss' transformation. This will provide a decent attack window.</li>
        </ul>
