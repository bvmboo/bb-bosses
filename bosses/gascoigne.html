        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p1>Father Gascoigne is one of the hunters of Yharnam. His obsession with 
            beast hunting has become so dire that his thirst for blood turned him 
            into one.

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You can use the music box given by the young girl in Yharnam to briefly stun Gascoigne.</li>
            <li>Make use of the tombstones and other obstacles to protect yourself from wide axe swings.</li>
            <li>Stock up on Molotov Cocktails for his second phase.</li>
            <li>During his 2nd phase, distance yourself from him to prompt a dash attack that is easily parriable.</li>
        </ul>
