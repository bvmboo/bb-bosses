        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p1>The Moon Presence is a Great One in contract with Gehrman. It is presumed 
            that it is also the source of Paleblood which is the Hunter's main objective. 
            If met, no doubt it will try to tempt you in replacing Gehrman in order to 
            prolong the Hunter's Dream.
