        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p1>Micolash is one of the scholars of Mensis. As seen before being transported into 
            the Lecture Hall, the Hunter enters a room full of mummified corpses with cages. 
            It was said that a ritual attempt to beckon the moon was made and so, it is possible 
            that Micolas ended up an anchor point between the Waking World and the Nightmare.

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not be greedy with attacks, as he dodges quite often and can chain with an attack.</li>
            <li>Bait his tentacle attack to dodge sideways and throw in a few attacks.</li>
            <li>During his 2nd phase, avoid the homing stars spell by dodging into Micolash as the stars launch.</li>
        </ul>
