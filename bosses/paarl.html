        <h3>Tips</h3>

            <li>Paarl is very weak to blunt damage, provided you can land a powerful charged attack on it.</li>
            <li>Limit his time coated in electricity by breaking his stance.</li>
            <li>Take advantage of it trying to recharge as it offers a good window to attack.</li>
