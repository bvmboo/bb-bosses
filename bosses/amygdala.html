        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p1>Numerous Amygdalas can be found throughout Yharnam, but the one at the Nightmare Frontier 
            is guarding one of the precious Chalices often mentioned by Gehrman. It is a nine-armed 
            creature who generates vortexes at the center of its palms and can shoot lasers out of 
            its many eyes.

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bolt damage is effective against the creature that relates to God-type enemies.</li>
            <li>Its weakspot, though hard to reach, is its head along with one of the arms that has white skin exposed.</li>
            <li>Try to remain on its side and never dodge backwards to avoid getting hit by most of its attacks.</li>
        </ul>
