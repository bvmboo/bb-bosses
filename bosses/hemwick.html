        <h2>Description</h2>

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ignore the Shades that spawn in the arena as more will take their place.</li>
            <li>Focus on Backstabs and Visceral Attacks as the witch is slow and barely moving.</li>
            <li>Be wary of the light orbs that will capture you if touched during the 2nd phase.</li>
        </ul>
