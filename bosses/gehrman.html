        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p1>Gehrman, though an iconic figure in the world of hunters, has hidden 
            obsessions towards a specific person. This has led him to form a contract 
            with a Great One and thus, the Hunter's Dream came to life. An inescapable 
            place to the host of it, which is currently none other than Gehrman himself.

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Most of his attacks are parriable, when timed properly.</li>
            <li>Avoid his charged bullet (blue aura) as it will stagger you and set you up for a critical.</li>
            <li>Regular attacks can stagger him and stop his attack pattern.</li>
        </ul>
