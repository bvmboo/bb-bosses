        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p1>Born of unholy ritual, the One Reborn is an amalgam of the bodies piled up 
            in Yharnam, merged into a disgusting creature. It is supported by witches 
            around the arena.

        <ul>
            <li>Take care of the witches supporting the boss as they will keep healing it.</li>
